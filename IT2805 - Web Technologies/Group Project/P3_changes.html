        <h1>Changes</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>Visual Changes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Background Image was changed. On longer pages the image from the design plan would be asymmetric</p> 
                <p><strike>Page_design2.PNG</strike> => bg_light.jpg</p>
                <p><strike>Page_design_dark</strike> => bg_dark.jpg</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Font type was changed. The last font wouldn't load properly and when it did it wasn't readable.</p>
                <p><strike>font-family:"sendha";</strike> => Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif on all p-tags and h1-tags</p>
                <p><strike>font-family:"sendha";</strike> => 'Courier New', Courier, monospace on all h2-tags to separate out page headers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sidebar is changed. The color was too easy to overlook and it got a new alternative (Dark/Light mode) since the placement of this
                    function wasn't specified in the design plan.</p>
                <p>Light Mode: <strike>color:lightgray;</strike> => color:black;</p>
                <p>Dark Mode: <strike>not specified</strike> => color:rgba(100,0,0,0.9)</p>
                <p>Sidebar Items: <strike>History, Favorites</strike> => History, Favorites, Dark/Light Mode</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cards layout is changed. The pyramid model for the cards layout was flawed because the cards at the bottom at the pyramid were too 
                    small to be read.</p>
                <p>Cards Layout: <strike>Pyramid Model</strike> => Model of 1 large card, then 2 small cards, repeated.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
            <hr>
            <h3>JavaScript Changes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>hover_menu.js, dark_mode.js are now functions within script.js. This is to increase modularity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>fetch_bot.js is changed. APIs weren't allowed, so we replaced this function with the favorite function</p>
                <p><strike>fetch_bot.js</strike> => folder: local_favs_scripts, file: genereate_favorite_table</p>
                <p>The folder contains a unique script for each HTML page to store locally from.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>search_bar.js is changed. We lost group members unannounced and therefore also capacity. This was changed to history/log function to finish the project faster</p>
                <p><strike>search_bar.js</strike> => folder: local_log_scripts, file: genereate_history_table</p>
                <p>The folder contains a unique script for each HTML page to store locally from.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3>structure change</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>style.css has changed name and directory position. This is to enhance directory structure and give it a more fitting name</p>
                <p><strike>style.css</strike> => stylesheets/main.css</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>circuit_head.ico has changed name and directory position. This is to enhance directory structure and give it a more fitting name</p>
                <p><strike>circuit_head.ico</strike> => images/favicon.png</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3>Group members and resposibilites</h3>
        <p>Due to a cut in group members, we had new resposibilites as follows.</p>
