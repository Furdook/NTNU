Assignment 8: Questions


1. When calling getContext('2d') on a Canvas element, it will return a drawing context (i.e. the type of canvas) - in this case a two-dimensional context. How can we get a three-dimensional context instead? 
To get a three-dimensional context you’ll have to use webgl rather than 2d in getContext()


2. How would you create a blue circle using the Canvas element? Explain with words or code. 
To create the blue circle in canvas you first need to begin the path before making it arc the whole way around your intended coordinates and size. Do so using the arc() function. Afterwards you can set the fillStyle to blue and fill the circle before calling stroke()


3. What is a more terse (also known as shorter) way of writing the loop in the following using the Array.filter method?
const countries = ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'New Zealand']
const countriesStartingWithN = []

countriesStartingWithN.push(countries.filter(function(a) {
   return a.charAt(0) === 'N'
}))
